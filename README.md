# RedditMyProfessor
A website to aggregate feedback on courses and professors that are posted to the /r/RPI subreddit and displaying them in an easily digestible format. The website will include a measure of the frequency of words associated with a course or professor, a ranking of the “popularity” of courses, and the ability to compare professors who teach the same course.
